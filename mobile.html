		  <p>Last week we saw unofficial renders showing off the four color options of the Samsung Galaxy S21 and Galaxy S21+. Those weren't 100% accurate, though, the official images uncovered by WinFuture do a much better job of showing the hues of the back panel and the metal frame (which melds into the camera bump). The leaked official videos caused some excitement with the two-tone color scheme. That is most noticeable on the Violet version. The White one is more subdued with white back and silver frame. The Pink and Dark Grey colorways use a single hue for their frames and back panels.<a href="http://bit.ly/3nsvbU8">Continue reading.</a></p>
