		  <h2>Iphone 12 Series Launching & Review</h2>
		  <img src="images/iphone.jpg" style="height:200px;">
		  <p>The iPhone 12 is the kind of product Apple only releases once in a while the kind that looks different, is built on a fundamentally new technology, and will ultimately form the basis of future iPhones for years to come.</p>
		  <p>It's fortunate, then, that the new iPhone that most people will probably buy is also mostly a success. The iPhone 12 has an attractive new design, a straightforward and complete approach to 5G, good cameras and even better performance.</p>
		  <p>But an iPhone of all trades is a master of none, and thus, the iPhone 12 isn't perfect, either. A low amount of base storage and the lack of a charger included in box means this iPhone isn't as inexpensive as it may initially seem. Additionally, some of the best features coming out of the Android realm, like super-sharp digital zoom and fast-refresh rate displays, are missing in action here.</p>
